    A helper class for testing transformations of the FHIR 'Location' resource.
    This class extends the FhirResourceTestHelper and is specifically
    designed to assist in testing the transformation of the 'Location' resource.

    Attributes:
        resource_type (str): The type of FHIR resource being tested, which
          is set to 'Location'.
        resource (dict): The raw FHIR 'Location' resource payload to be tested.
        expected_output (dict): The expected transformation result of the
          'Location' resource payload.
