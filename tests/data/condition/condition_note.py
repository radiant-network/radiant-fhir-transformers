    A helper class for testing transformations of the FHIR 'Condition' resource.

    This class extends the FhirResourceTestHelper and is specifically

    It predefines the resource type as 'Condition'
    and initializes the resource with the specific 'Condition' resource payload
    and its expected transformation output.

    Attributes:
        resource_type (str): The type of FHIR resource being tested, which

        resource_subtype (str): The subtype of the FHIR resource being tested, which
          is set to 'note'.

        transformer: The transformer class used for transforming the FHIR resource.

        expected_table_name (str): The name of the expected output table.
