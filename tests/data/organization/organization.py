    A helper class for testing transformations of the FHIR 'Organization' resource.

    This class extends the FhirResourceTestHelper and is specifically

        resource_type (str): The type of FHIR resource being tested, which
          is set to 'Organization'.

        resource (dict): The raw FHIR 'Organization' resource payload to be tested.
